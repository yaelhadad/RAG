Frontegg launched Frontegg.ai, a platform designed to provide secure identity management for AI agent developers, helping companies manage autonomous systems effectively. 
The platform ensures secure identity management and protects sensitive data across multiple environments, while AI agents are rapidly becoming central to enterprise operations. 
Frontegg.ai simplifies onboarding for multiple tenants and integrates seamlessly with popular tools such as Slack, Jira, and HubSpot, enhancing operational efficiency.
It also provides enterprise-grade security policies and access controls, ensuring that every user has the right permissions at the right time.
Builders can now deploy fully functional AI agents in minutes, significantly reducing development time and accelerating time-to-value for enterprises.
This streamlined deployment process allows teams to focus on building smarter AI features rather than managing infrastructure.
